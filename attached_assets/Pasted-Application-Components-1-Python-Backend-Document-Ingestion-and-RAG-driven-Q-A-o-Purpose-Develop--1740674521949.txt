Application Components
1. Python Backend (Document Ingestion and RAG-driven Q&A)
o Purpose: Develop a backend application in Python to handle
document ingestion, embedding generation, and retrieval-based Q&A
(RAG).
o Key APIs:
▪ Document Ingestion API: Accepts document data, generates
embeddings using a Large Language Model (LLM) library, and
stores them for future retrieval.
▪ Q&A API: Accepts user questions, retrieves relevant document
embeddings, and generates answers based on the retrieved
content using RAG.
▪ Document Selection API: Enables users to specify which
documents to consider in the RAG-based Q&A process.
o Tools/Libraries:
▪ Use LLM libraries (e.g., OpenAI API or Hugging Face
Transformers).
▪ Database for storing embeddings (Postgres preferred).
▪ Asynchronous programming for efficient handling of API
requests.
2. NestJS Backend (User Management and Document Management)
o Purpose: Create a backend service using NestJS to manage user
authentication, document management, and ingestion controls.
o Key APIs:
▪ Authentication APIs: Register, login, logout, and handle user
roles (admin, editor, viewer).
▪ User Management APIs: Admin-only functionality for managing
user roles and permissions.
▪ Document Management APIs: CRUD operations for
documents, including the ability to upload documents.
▪ Ingestion Trigger API: Allows triggering the ingestion process
in the Python backend, possibly via a webhook or API call.
▪ Ingestion Management API: Tracks and manages ongoing
ingestion processes.
o Tools/Libraries:
▪ TypeScript for consistent type management.
▪ Database integration (Postgres recommended).
▪ JWT for authentication, with role-based authorization.
3. ▪ Microservices architecture to facilitate interaction between
NestJS and the Python backend.
Angular Frontend (User Interface for Management and Q&A)
o Purpose: Develop an Angular-based frontend to handle user
interactions with the backend services, document management,
ingestion management, and RAG-based Q&A interface.
o Key Pages/Features:
▪ Sign Up, Login, and Logout: User authentication interface.
▪ User Management: Admin-only access for managing users and
assigning roles.
▪ Document Upload and Management: Interface to upload and
manage documents.
▪ Ingestion Management: Interface to trigger and monitor
ingestion status.
▪ Q&A Interface: A user-friendly interface for asking questions,
receiving answers, and displaying relevant document excerpts
(using RAG).
o UI Considerations:
▪ Responsive design for multiple devices and browsers.
▪ Modular, reusable components for better code structure.
▪ Consistency with design patterns to ensure maintainability and
scalability.
